C++ port of CSG.js (in progress)
================================
This is the beginning of a C++ port of CSG.js used in OpenJSCAD (https://github.com/jscad/csg.js). OpenJSCAD's CSG.js has significant performance
improvements over the original CSG.js (https://github.com/evanw/csg.js/), which was ported to C++ here (https://github.com/dabroz/csgjs-cpp).
The speed of OpenJSCAD's CSG.js implmented in JavaScript is faster than the original C++ port, so the idea is
to get those gains and more by implementing OpenJSCAD's CSG.js in C++.
